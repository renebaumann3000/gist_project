# GIST Project - A blog for a rare form of cancer

## Introduction:
This project is a real initiative involving an actual "client" and a genuine use case. My mother has been battling cancer since she was 18 years old, which means even before I was born. In recent years, she got affected by a rare type of tumor known as GIST. More information about GIST can be found here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastrointestinal_stromal_tumor. She actively participates in a GIST support group. The group has long desired to have its own blog for two main reasons: 1. to spread awareness about the disease, and 2. to simplify the process for people to connect with such a support group. Therefore, the Full Stack project was a perfect match for this purpose. Apart from myself and a friend, the individuals currently registered on the platform for testing are members of this support group.
Attention: the group is based in Berlin Germay, so some blog posts are in german!

## Self-Reflection:
I begin this README with a self-reflection to clarify the status of the project. The technical aspect of this project has been overwhelming for me, almost pushing me to give up. I would have preferred a more intensive "tandem" for learning purposes for this project. Fortunately, my network helped me with debugging and was there for me during an emotionally difficult time. I started with the PP4 walkthrough. For me personally, understanding the Django settings was challenging from the outset. It's like trying to learn how to drive a car. In the first driving lesson, before you even start driving, you have to tinker with the engine. As a beginner. Without any warning... Therefore, I sought my own way in and tried various other tutorials that worked better for me as an introduction to a Django project. Since the technical part of the project was difficult for me, I have not been able to fully complete the project by writing writing these lines. The design is not yet complete, and some features are not implemented. I will comment on the specific things in the respective sections.
I don't know if this project will be a fail. But the really good thing is that it's a real project that will continue to develop over time.
